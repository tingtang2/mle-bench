# Set the EDA findings as an environment variable
export EDA_FINDINGS="Here are the relevant results of the EDA: the target variable y is highly imbalanced with 87.93% being 0s and 12.06% being 1s. Also consider the file: openhands/playground-series-s5e8/correlation_matrix.csv, which contains correlation information between the various variables. Notably, pdays and poutcome, as well as poutcome and previous have very strong negative correlations while pdays and previous have a strong positive correlation. Consider other correlations as well: duration has the strongest positive correlation with the target. Accordingly you are allowed to downsample the majority class, and upweight the downsampled class as needed."
